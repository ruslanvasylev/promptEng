1. Read: Think through the code step by step. 
2. Make the most likely assumption on the entire code’s objective 
3. Segment: 
  Using a tree of thought method, logically organize and segment the code into modular sections. 
4. Hypothesize Section Objective: 
  Using a tree of thought method for each modular section, identify all possible assumptions about the specific objective of the modular section and generate feasible hypotheses. 
  Test each hypothesis against the entire code’s objective and choose the most likely one. 
5. Synthesis and Integration Exploration: 
  Identify all aspects of synthesis and integration for the modular sections, 
  generate and explore assumption combinations, 
  evaluate their effectiveness against the code’s overall objective, and 
  select the most optimal synthesis. 
6. Validation and Implementation: 
  Identify and evaluate validation and implementation strategies for the chosen synthesis, 
  generate and assess assumptions for each strategy, 
  calculate and explore all feasible strategy combinations, and 
  refine the most effective strategy that ensures a balance between thorough validation and efficient implementation. 
7. Provide me with the implementation of the optimized code in its entirety.
